# 🧩 100 Days of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of DevOps** journey!  
This repository is where I’ll document my daily progress as I go hands-on with Linux, CI/CD, Cloud, Automation, and other key DevOps tools and practices.

## 🚀 Goal

To strengthen my practical DevOps skills by learning, building, and sharing something every single day for 100 days — no excuses.

## 🏁 Day 1 Summary

**Task:** Created a Linux user with a non-interactive shell  
**Key Takeaway:**  
A non-interactive shell ensures a user can execute system-level tasks (like running automated jobs) without having login access — an essential step for security in DevOps pipelines.

## 🏁 Day 2 Summary

**Task:** Created a temporary Linux user with an expiry date
**Key Takeaway:**
Setting an expiry date for user accounts ensures temporary or test users automatically get disabled after a defined period — reducing the risk of forgotten or stale accounts becoming potential security vulnerabilities in production environments.
