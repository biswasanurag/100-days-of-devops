# Introduction

Temporary User Setup with Expiry

# Why it is needed?

The need to create a user account with a specific expiry date is a core practice in IT Security and Access Management, especially for temporary roles.

Here's a breakdown of why this is needed for the developer ravi on the Nautilus project:

## üîí Security and Compliance

**1. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**
This is a fundamental security concept. ravi only needs access for the duration of the temporary assignment. Setting an expiration date ensures that his access is automatically revoked on 2023-12-07. This prevents:

Stale accounts: An account that is no longer needed but remains active, which is a significant security vulnerability.

Unauthorized access: The account can't be used by unauthorized individuals after ravi's assignment ends.

**2. Audit and Compliance**
In many organizations, especially those in regulated industries, maintaining clear records of who has access to sensitive systems and for how long is a mandatory compliance requirement. An expiry date provides a verifiable, built-in control for auditors, proving that access was granted for a limited duration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Efficiency

**3. Automated De-provisioning**
Instead of relying on an administrator to manually remember and disable the account on December 7th, the system handles the de-provisioning automatically. This saves administrative time and eliminates the risk of human error or oversight.

**4. Project-Based Access**
Since ravi is assigned specifically to the Nautilus project, the expiry date ties his system access directly to the project timeline. This is a best practice for managing contractors, consultants, or temporary staff access.

In short, creating the account with an expiry date is a simple command that provides a strong, auditable, and automated layer of security and control over temporary system access.
